<p><h3>Input</h3></p>

<p>The purpose of this dashboard is to calculate the quality of solutions (in a given decision problem) based on a set of criteria. As input, a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet composed of three sheets is reuuired. See the guidelines below.</p>

<h4>Criteria</h4>
<p>The first sheet, called "<em>criteria</em>" should include the following for each criterion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short name</li>
<li>Long name</li>
<li>Goal (min or max)</li>
<li>Domain (minimum and maximum possible values)</li>
<li>Preference order (an integer in the range \(\{1,...,m\}\), where \(m\) is the number of criteria). A value close to 1 indicates that the criterion is very important, a value close to m the opposite.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following figure shows an example of how the criteria data should be entered in the spreadsheet.</p>

<h4>Solutions</h4>
<p>Similarly, the <i>solutions</i> sheet should include the following for each solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short name</li>
<li>Long name</li>
</ul>

<p>The following figure shows how the solutions data should be entered in the spreadsheet.</p>

<h4>Evaluations</h4>
<p>Finally, the evaluations of each solution in each criterion should be entered as shown in the following figure:</p>
